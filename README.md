# Stack-and-Queue
Computer Graphics is concerned with all aspects of producing pictures or images using a computer. Using computer graphics, we can create images by computers that are indistinguishable from photographs of real objects. We are implementing our project using a particular graphics software system that is, OPENGL. OpenGL is strictly defined as “a software interface to graphics hardware.” In essence, it is a 3D graphics and modelling library that is extremely portable and very fast. Using OpenGL, you can create elegant and beautiful 3D graphics with nearly the visual quality. OpenGL is intended for use with computer hardware that is designed and optimized for the display and manipulation of 3D graphics. OpenGL is used for a variety of purposes, from CAD engineering and architectural applications to computer-generated dinosaurs in blockbuster movies. This aim of this project is to show the Implementation of Stack and Queue using a numbers as an element. The stack is a data structure which works on LIFO (Last In First Out) technique and queue is a data structure which works on FIFO (First In First Out). The numbers are pushed or popped in the stack while in the queue the numbers are inserted or deleted. When there is no element in the stack the message is shown as “Stack is Empty” and in queue it shows “No elements to display in queue”.
